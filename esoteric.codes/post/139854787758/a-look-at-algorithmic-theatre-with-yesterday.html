            This week we break from esoteric programming for a look at how code and human expression interact in theatre. In Annie Dorsen’s&nbsp;<i>Yesterday Tomorrow</i>, three performers (Hai-Ting Chinn, Jeffrey Gavett, and Natalie Raybould) sing Paul McCartney’s

            “Yesterday”

            repeatedly while it transforms in small incremets over an hour – according to a computer-generated score – to eventually arrive at

            “Tomorrow”

            from the musical Annie. In the middle of the transformation, the lines of music take on “an eerie liturgical quality, as if each singer were performing an individual Gregorian chant”

            according to the New York Times. In 2012, Dorsen wrote&nbsp;On Algorithmic Theatre,&nbsp;describing modes of algorithmic practice that challenge basic notions of what theatre is and how it functions.
        </p><p>Pierre Godard wrote the code for Yesterday Tomorrow and provides technical info about the process. He has created or contributed to a number of performative works that make use of code, including the recent dance performance <i>For Claude Shannon</i>.</p><p>

                How did you first arrive at
                the concept of Algorithmic Theatre?
            </b><br>
        </p><p>
            <b>Annie:&nbsp;</b>I’d already made <i>Hello Hi There</i>, or
            rather I was in the late stages of that process, when I invented that term. I’d
            started getting a sense that I was on the edge of something much larger than
            any one project, and that could perhaps initiate an entirely new way of making
            theatre. The beginning of Hello Hi There was actually the debate between Noam
            Chomsky and Michel Foucault. I thought I’d do something or other with that
            dialogue, it wasn’t clear what, and I met with a composer friend, Joanna Bailie
            (who is the musical director of Yesterday Tomorrow), to see if she might write
            some music for the project, and at some point in our discussion she mentioned
            Alan Turing and the 1950 essay “Computing Machinery and Intelligence.” Once
            I read it the whole project took shape in my mind. Not to go too far astray
            from your question…Turing’s essay argues that the traditional way of thinking
            about developing AI was no good – that trying to create the property of thought
            in a machine would never work, mostly because we don’t really understand what
            “thinking” is – we humans don’t know very much about consciousness, how we do
            it, how it works, and so on, so how could we possibly create it outside of ourselves?
            He proposed rather that we work on trying to persuasively convince a human
            observer that thought is taking place in a machine – in other words, that we
            try to create the effect of thought rather than thought itself. In his
            formulation, thought is in the mind of the observer, not an inherent property
            of a thing/being itself. It’s obviously one of the giant ideas of the 20<sup>th</sup>
            century, and when I read his essay, I realized how provocative it was for
            theatre. It’s inherently theatrical, it’s about the audience, it’s about the
            impact of an illusion on a human viewer. So that became the basis for Hello Hi
            There – to explore ideas about human nature, language, consciousness, natural
            language programming, and the relationship of all those to politics, by stirring
            together Alan Turing, Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault in a big pot.
        </p><p>
            As I got further in that work, I began to
            get excited by the theatrical potential of algorithms more broadly. I started
            to see algorithms almost like little dramaturgs and little performers all in
            one, ordering and sorting information and presenting their results. There’s a
            kind of old cliché about theatre, originally from Stanislavski, you hear it in
            theatre classes all the time: “theatre is action.” And it was this quality of
            algorithms to act autonomously (or semi-autonomously) that really got me
            thinking about a whole range of projects I could do that would explore
            algorithms as theatre artists.&nbsp;
        </p><p>

            I have always been more
            interested in theatre machinery, the structure, the whole apparatus, than in
            acting or in playwriting. I liked very much that by making theatre with
            computers as my primary collaborators I could dispense with a whole lot of
            theatre traditions and so-called accepted truths. Since then I’ve done a big
            research on early algorithmic visual art, and I think what I’m doing with
            theatre is analogous to the work of that first generation of computer artists,
            who were really experimenting with how to work with computers as compositional
            partners. I’m trying to bring algorithms into the theatre on the ground floor
            level, so to speak, and there are some challenges that arise, really
            fascinating problems to try to solve. &nbsp;

                    Is it important to
                    the concept of the piece that the work be different each time it’s performed?
                    How have the performers responded to this challenge?&nbsp;
                </b>
            </b>
        </p><p>
            <b>Annie:&nbsp;</b>Oh yes, definitely. For one, that gives
            the work it’s live aspect – the computer system is improvising, each time. It’s
            not functioning as a playback machine, but rather is doing some creative work
            in real time. The focus is on the algorithm’s performance as well as that of
            the singers.
        </p><p>
            But maybe more importantly this is
            connected to the notion of multiples, there is no canonical ‘fixed’ version of
            the music (or in the case of Hello Hi There of the dialogue, or in
                <i>
                    A Piece of
                    Work
                </i>
             of the adaptation of the Shakespeare text). The music any given audience
            hears is just one possible output. The code is the fixed element and each
            night’s expression of that code is contingent, one of many.
        </p><p>

            In Yesterday Tomorrow the
            singers have no idea what music will be coming at them in the moment, and I
            think it’s big big fun for them. It’s not only an interesting challenge for
            musicians as skilled as they are – but it also gives them this kind of game to
            play, there’s an urgency and spontaneity to the performance that’s important to
            the thematics of the piece. They are forced to stay in the moment and to let
            the computer-generated music pass through them – so they become in a way part
            of the interface, part of the construction that allows the computer to present
            its work.

                    As the Yesterday song takes
                    on aspects of the Tomorrow song, the first thing that’s noticeable are small
                    rhythm changes. Do rhythm, melody, and syllables change independently of each
                    other in the algorithm? Were there other dimensions of the music that change
                    from the first song to the second?
                </b>&nbsp;



            </b><br>
        </p><p>
            <b>Annie:&nbsp;</b>Yes, we alter everything separately –
            each aspect is changing according to independent equations. These kinds of
            decisions were a big part of the rehearsal process for the piece, setting some
            parameters for the overall shape of the music. The other external logic we
            imposed was the tempo – that was in a way an obvious thing to alter through the
            course of the piece, to hear the results of the algorithm as completely as
            possible. During the music’s most chaotic scrambled phase we do a shift to very
            very fast (300bpm) down to very very slow (20bpm) – so that we experience it in
            radically different ways. And then from a theatre perspective of course, it
            also allows a shift in perception, which makes some relationship to the notions
            of past, present, and future we’re playing with.

                    Could you tell us a bit
                    about what type of algorithm was used, and how it was developed? Did you know
                    the work was going to be about an hour when you started? I’m curious about when these parameters became clear and how
                    they were refined as the software was developed.
                </b>
            </b><br>
        </p><p>
            <b>Annie:&nbsp;</b>I went through a couple of different
            versions of the code. To begin with, I wanted the primary system to be a
            genetic algorithm, so the computer would have to arrive at “Tomorrow” through a
            learning process. I was attracted to the evolutionary model for the match it
            made with the metaphoric layer, but it quickly became clear that that was not a
            great way to go. I was working with a different programmer at that time, and he
            wrote a very clever program, but it just never got anywhere near “Tomorrow.”
            Not even close. And I knew I wanted that moment of arrival – I didn’t want to
            set “Tomorrow” as a goal but then just see what we got at some arbitrary end
            point – I really wanted to have the complete path. So we ended up using a kind
            of migration algorithm that would shift the pitches and the durations of each
            note from “Tomorrow” to “Yesterday” in a series of steps. So the number of
            steps is decided by us – we started with 40 I think, our first tests, but we
            felt it was too long, we were in the scramble for too long to stay interesting.
            So we kept shortening it until it felt right, now we’re at 30 steps. Some of
            that also had to do with the physical limitations of the singers – I wasn’t
            interested in totally exhausting them, or in them killing their voices, and
            it’s not such an easy score to sing – so we kept it reasonable, both for their
            sakes and for the audience’s attention.
        </p><p>
            Most of our rehearsal work was spent
            finessing the algorithm – the equations that govern the rates of change, the
            tempo shifts, and of course setting up and debugging the interface, how the
            score will appear visually so it makes sense in terms of musical notation and
            the singers can read it.&nbsp;
        </p><p>

            The core team in all this
            was Pierre Godard (programmer) and Joanna Bailie (composer) and me – we each
            have a different area of expertise, you could say, so there was a kind of
            productive push pull around the integrity of the algorithm, the integrity of
            the music, and the integrity of the event or experience as theatre.
        </p><p>
            Will let Pierre
            answer in more detail…
        </p><p>
            <b>





                Pierre:
            </b>&nbsp;So the migration in Yesterday Tomorrow is relying on
            iteratively mixing gaussian distributions centered around “paired” notes from
            Yesterday and Tomorrow. The pairing is randomized for each performance (if i
            remember correctly, Tomorrow had more notes and so it was necessary to drop
            some of them randomly to have a one-to-one association with Yesterday’s notes,
            and then eventually re-inject them later in the process). Once every note from
            Yesterday is associated with a note from Tomorrow (the “target” note), we
            decide for each note with a certain probability if its pitch should be changed
            or not. This probability is very low at the beginning of the migration and
            increases (according to a sigmoid “S-shaped” function) to reach 1 at the end of
            the migration. If we decided (or rather the pseudo-random number generator did)
            to change the pitch, we make the mixture decision: is the new pitch going to be
            drawn according to a gaussian distribution centered on Yesterday’s note’s pitch
            or Tomorrow’s? At the beginning of the migration, we’re more likely to be
            centered on Yesterday’s pitch and as we move forward, more likely to be
            centered on Tomorrow’s pitch. Then we draw a new pitch (which also involves
            choosing a standard deviation, that also evolves throughout the migration and
            is at its highest in the middle of the piece. Note here that Joanna proposed to
            use a chosen “musical” distance rather than just a pitch difference, so a
            perfect fifth is for example a smaller jump than a minor second). We repeat
            this for duration and syllables, which gives us a modified version of
            Yesterday, and we iterate the whole process from this current version of the
            song. I should add that when we have reached either the target pitch (or
            duration or syllable) of one of Tomorrow’s notes, the probability of changing
            it equals 1 minus the “sigmoid” probability i mentioned above. That, together
            with the evolving standard deviations we chose, ensures that the whole thing
            converges to Tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p><p>
            This program is rather ad-hoc, it does what it’s
            supposed to do and doesn’t have too much of a gravity center on its own
            conceptually. However, as Annie was saying, a lot of work went into finessing
            it and fine-tuning its parameters. Each step of it is very simple, but its
            iterative nature makes some complexity arise, and intricate effects start to
            manifest. You inherit anything that happens throughout the process. Faster
            change rates at some point in the migration can lead to slower ones later, or
            more noise lead to a more abrupt “resolution” into Tomorrow.

            <b>Pierre:</b>

            The code producing the score is written in
            Python, but all the interface for the singers is built with Max, and a Max
            library called ”bach“&nbsp;developed by
            composers Andrea Agostini and Daniele Ghisi.

                    in your&nbsp;"On
                    Algorithmic Theatre,” you talk about the algorithm as both performer and
                    collaborator. What was it like&nbsp;adding human performers to the mix,
                    mediating the algorithmic output? I’m curious if the mix of comfort and rigor
                    on the set references this collaboration (the couches, those boot/sock things,
                    etc).
                </b>
            </b><br>
        </p><p>
            <b>Annie:&nbsp;</b>The design of the piece has more to do
            with what I refer to as the theatre-side of things, by which I really mean the
            metaphoric aspect. I was thinking about my own experience of change over time –
            that days, months, years pass but there is a certain continuity, especially of
            the most banal aspects of living: sitting on a couch, brushing your teeth,
            making tea, that sort of thing. At one point I was thinking about each move on
            a sofa kind of standing in for a different moment, like if you would take a
            photo once a day for a year, you would have all these images of different
            positions on the same piece of furniture. The weather outside would go from
            winter to spring to summer to fall, wars might start or end, love comes and
            goes, and all that - but inside at home the person is just one day sitting with
            legs crossed and the next day has an arm over the back of the couch.
        </p><p>

            Once we put the whole thing
            together, I found it was a good opportunity to make some associations with the
            ubiquity of algorithms in our lives, the extent to which we are already 'taking
            direction’ from them, how much our daily lives are entwined with and shaped by
            these little pieces of code. The sofas, the laptop, the TV, the iphone – that
            staging became a way to bring out what was already inherent in the piece: three
            hopeful humans with their eyes (of necessity) glued to a screen, being kind of
            bossed around by this computational system. I’ve been putting it like this: you
            don’t choose what you get from the world, but you do choose what you do with it,
            sometimes only in limited ways. But still and nonetheless, those choices
            matter.

            Yes, contemporary
            art, but equally contemporary dance. I started to get a bit of a dance
            education in the mid-2000s, at a place called Performing Arts Forum in France
            (it’s an amazing place, I won’t go into it but interested people can check out www.pa-f.net). In particular, two aspects to what people were
            doing there drew my attention. The first was the overall project to posit
            thinking as a physical action, and physical action as a form of thinking. When
            I began to explore what that notion could mean to me in my theatre practice, I
            imagined a form of theatre in which an idea, rather than a represented
            character, would take the place of the protagonist. In other words, the
            audience would be tracking the development and changes and so-called 'arc’ of
            an idea rather than that of an actor playing a role. The second aspect was a
            methodology; most of the choreographers I met at or via PAF were making dances
            through the development of a score, or a precise procedure. That wasn’t new to
            dance in the 2000s, of course, but it was new to me, coming from the New York
            theatre scene. And that way of thinking about process opened a big new field of
            experimentation.

            The influence of
            visual art came a little later (except insofar as the dance works that
            influenced me were themselves influenced by conceptual art, minimalism and
            other postmodern forms of the 60s and 70s.) I’d started looking into the work
            of early computer artists, Manfred Mohr and Roman Verostko and others. I
            mentioned above that as I was in such an early stage of development with
            algorithmic theatre, I felt I could learn a lot from the corresponding early
            stage of computer art. I read some texts by Manfred Mohr from the late 60s that
            struck me as really helpful, some artist’s statements he’d written that laid
            out the basic principles he was working from. Those writings helped clarify
            some questions I’d had already, and alerted me to some fundamental differences
            in medium between visual art and theatre that provoked some good thinking. At
            times during the creation of A Piece of Work, it seemed like anytime I was
            stuck I could go back to one of Mohr’s texts and find he’d dealt with some
            analogous problem in his own work. A lot of the issues have to do with how to
            define the steps involved – so you can teach a computer how to do it. That
            means being able to make the process rational and concrete, which for all kinds
            of reasons is a different ballgame in theatre than in two-dimensional graphic
            art works. I have decided to pursue a back and forth between me and the
            algorithm, a mix of the rational and the irrational, the mathematical and the
            aesthetic. My big interest in this work, after all, is to understand something
            about how humans and the tools we create mutually transform each other, how we
            create the tools and the tools create us back.
