However, these programmes were internally different from any ‘real’ programme, because they were neither utilitarian nor instrumentalizing. Our real social, political, and technical programmes are oriented toward achieving a certain goal - and they are judged according to their efficiency or ability to achieve this goal. Art programmes and machines, however, are not teleologically oriented. They have no definite goals; they simply go on and on.</p></blockquote><p>If instruction-based techniques become art through intentional non-utility, programming languages become theoretical or esoteric through similar means; they give up practicality in the pursuit of exploration and experimentation. Since it is not easy for us to use them to program, we’re forced to take a step back and consider why the language is this way, what the work is saying.</p><p>If we think of LeWitt’s pieces as code and performance, perhaps the most relevant of his works to esolangs are the pieces that refer to instructions themselves, such as&nbsp;<i>Wall Drawing #248</i> (above) from Dia’s collection. These are not truly quines (the writing that appears in the piece are not the instructions for drawing the work), but they are instruction-like enough to create self-referentiality and a mix of instruction and performance (the lines) on the same plane. There is no way to consider the work purely aesthetically, the words force us to consider their conceptual framework.</p>  </div>
