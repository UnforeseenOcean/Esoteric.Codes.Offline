                Meaning in Mistakes: Connect to the wrong wifi and every site serves inexplicable words

        <p>Joe Moore’s <i>Meaning in Mistakes</i> is a collection of ambiguously misspelled words: each has two sets of adjacent letters that can be swapped to form correctly spelled (US) English words. The word&nbsp;“saets,” for instance, could resolve to “sates” a desire or&nbsp;“seats” someone at the table.</p><p>Beginning as a list posted to his website, later iterations of this project present the list acid-etched in a mirror, or a television set with the single example <i>infiedls</i> etched into its screen. Version 3, however, presents the work to an unsuspecting audience: a wifi router, which has lived in various parts of the city, serves the words to anyone who connects to it, regardless of what site they try to access.<br></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1210" data-orig-width="602"><img src="../../../78.media.tumblr.com/afead5950767038e755490b6cdcb0222/tumblr_inline_ozd79iRWiO1qaohdj_1280.png" data-orig-height="1210" data-orig-width="602" alt="image" width="500" height="1004"></figure><p><i>An excerpt from version 3</i></p><p>
            <b>
                &gt;&gt; When
                someone connects to your wifi network, does any url resolve to your list of
                ambiguous words, or how do they find the site?
            </b>
        </p><p>
            Version 3 of “Meaning in Mistakes” runs off of a
            cheap travel wifi router with openwrt (a variant of linux) loaded as the
            operating system and an antenna soldered to the board to extend the reach of
            its radio. I set the router up as a captive portal running a webserver, dns,
            etc. When someone connects to the network, it’s self contained, any URL they
            try to connect to is going to resolve back to an HTML document on the device
            that contains “Meaning in Mistakes.” Additionally, the name of the
            wifi network changes every 10 minutes to one of the 88 sets, which sets up
            another potential for context to effect the text. Looking at available networks
            a user would see a set from the work along with other networks names in their
            vicinity. People connect either purposefully (they are looking for open wifi)
            or they may just have their phone set to connect to any open wifi network. This
            creates yet another context, attempting to visit Amazon.com and seeing the list
            in its place could create some interesting associations for the viewer.

                &gt;&gt; Where
                have you had it set up in the city?
            </b>
        </p><p>
            From around 2013-2016 version 3 ran from my apartment window
            in Bushwick, Brooklyn. I can also power it with a small cell phone battery, so
            I would throw it into a bag and take it around New York with me on public
            transit. It has also lived in my office at The City College of New York, where
            I teach. It’s a kind of situated net art, only available within the device’s
            limited wifi range. This joins place to the reading of the work, unlike most
            net art which can be seen from anywhere with a connection to the internet. Each
            situation alters and extends the activity of perception. For me perception is
            not an apolitical activity or a passive position, but an activity culturally
            constituted and directed.

            <b>
                &gt;&gt; How
                did you draw up the list of words?
            </b>
        </p><p>
            &nbsp;A few years back the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg sent me an
            abstract from an academic paper on an experiment with word recognition and
            reading speed. As I remember it the experiment described was this, take a
            paragraph and randomly sort every letter in every word with the exception of
            the first and last letter of each word. The researchers found that there was
            very little speed difference between those reading the sorted and unsorted
            versions of the paragraph, meaning that we read by looking at shape rather than
            individual characters. The nice thing about this abstract was that someone
            performed the described manipulation to it, so all the “inner”
            letters of every word had been randomly sorted. I thought about the study and
            how the surrounding words help reduce ambiguity since surely there were words
            in the paragraph that could be “corrected” multiple ways if taken out
            of context. This led me to write a program to find character sets that could
            become more than one word from a very large word list with a single character
            transposition. Another rule is that the potential words also had to share the
            same first and last letter.
        </p><p>
            <b>
                &gt;&gt; Are
                you adding to it regularly?
            </b>&nbsp;
        </p><p>
            In one sense I don’t add to it, but the materials,
            distribution, etc, change in some way with each version, so in another way I
            do. I’ve also created versions of the work where only a selection of the
            initial 88 are used. For example version 2 is a selection of 10 from the first
            list, each acid etched into a mirror. There’s a philosophical aspect to your
            question, concerning what constitutes a new or different work, and that is one
            of the reasons I often work in series and use appropriation and translation between
            materials as part of my process. Questions around copies and originals or
            similarity and difference aren’t new, but remain interesting and compelling for
            me.

            <b>
                &gt;&gt; Tell
                me a bit about who you look at
            </b>
        </p><p>
            William Burroughs and Brion
            Gysin are an early and important influence and one that’s easy to see in
            this&nbsp; work. Artist/Poets associated with concrete poetry, language poetry,
            and early net.art. My practice also includes photography and video and so
            there’s quite a bit of image based work that’s important to me. Structuralist
            and experimental films by Michael Snow, Ernie Gehr, Hollis Frampton, Chantal
            Akerman, Paul Sharits, and Peter Kubelka to name a few. Video art by Steina and
            Woody Vasulka, Garry Hill, etc. Photography by Étienne-Jules Marey, Anna Atkins,
            Broomberg and Chanarin, Martha Rosler, Peter Piller, the list goes on. Some of
            this work I’ve been looking at for a long time and some of it doesn’t look much
            like the work I make. Reading and talking with people is an important part of
            my practice. Version 3 of the project wouldn’t have happened if Dan Phiffer
            didn’t create his wifi based project occupy.here and turn me on to working with
            cheap routers and openwrt. Things I’ve read recently include Mel Y. Chen’s book
            “Animacies,” Nichole Shukin’s “Animal Capital,” and
            Rob&nbsp;Nixon’s “Slow Violence.” Historians like Aby Warburg and
            Didi-Huberman have influenced a number of my works. Roma Publications puts out
            some amazing photographic/conceptual editions with numerous artists I’ve been looking
            at. Kelly Jazvac’s recent show using Plastiglomerates at Fierman Gallery in NYC
            was great. You can’t go wrong with Hans Holbein’s 1533 painting “The
            Ambassadors.”
